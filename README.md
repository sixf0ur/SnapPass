# SnapPass
A Xposed module to bypass snapchat screenshot detection.

## Supported Versions:
SnapPass uses Dexplore to search for the method in the local apk. This becomes very handy when Snapchat updates are pushed and method names change. In the future, I won't have to update the repository with every new Snapchat release.
Tested and working on the following
- <= 12.25.0.35

If the Snapchat version is compatible and the Hook loads you can see a Toast message when opening Snapchat.
